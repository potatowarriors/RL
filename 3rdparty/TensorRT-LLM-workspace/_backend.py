"""Custom PEP 517 build backend for TensorRT-LLM.

Two hooks implement the two-phase build:

  prepare_metadata_for_build_wheel
      Returns static dist-info fast — no GPU / compilation required.
      Called by `uv lock` and by `uv sync` before deciding whether to build.

  build_wheel
      Invokes tools/build-custom-trtllm.sh (≈60 min on GB200).
      Called by `uv sync --extra trtllm` when the wheel is not yet cached.

The package is declared as no-build-isolation-package in the root
pyproject.toml so this backend runs inside the main venv and has access
to torch, ninja, cmake, and the CUDA toolkit.

Build coordinates (git URL / ref) are read from the workspace's
``[tool.trtllm]`` table in pyproject.toml.
